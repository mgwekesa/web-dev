    <h1>Interneting is Easy</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <!-- Unordered lists are used when the order of the list is not important -->
    <ul>
      <li>Add a 'ul' element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own 'li' element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <!-- An ordered list is used when the order of the list is important -->
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new 'ol' element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- <em> element is an 'emphasis' element, and when used it italizes the text.
    It is an example of an 'inline element' that affects a span of text inside of a block element -->
    <h2>Inline Element</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

    <!-- <<strong> is another example of an inline element. It makes the text be bold -->
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <!-- Most of the elements we have dealt with either wrap text content or other HTML elements.
    However, there are other elements that can be 'empty' or even 'self-closing' -->

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <p>Regards,<br>  <!-- '<br>' is used to impose a 'hard line break' -->

    <!-- '<hr>' is used to convey a thematic break; a transition from one scene of a story into the next -->

    <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix it with some CSS soon.</p>
